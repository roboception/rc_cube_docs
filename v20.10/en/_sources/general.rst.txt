Overview

The

rc_cube

 is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device that is developed to
enhance the computing capabilities of the Roboception stereo-camera

rc_visard

.

The

rc_cube

 provides real-time camera images and disparity images, which can also
be used to compute depth images and 3D point clouds. Additionally, it
provides confidence and error images as quality measures for each
image acquisition. It offers an intuitive web UI (user interface) and
a standardized GenICam interface, making it compatible with all major
image processing libraries.

With optionally available

rc_reason

 modules the

rc_cube

 provides out-of-the-box solutions for object detection and robotic
pick-and-place applications.


The terms "sensor," "

rc_visard

 65," and "

rc_visard

 160" used throughout the manual all refer to the Roboception

rc_visard

 family of self-registering cameras. Installation and control for all
sensors are exactly the same, and all use the same mounting base.

Note: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual
  applies to both the

  rc_visard

   65 and

  rc_visard

   160 versions of the Roboception sensor.


Note: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units
  meter and millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in
  technical drawings are in millimeters.
