Optional software components

The

rc_cube

 offers optional software components that can be activated by
purchasing a separate

license

.

The

rc_cube

's optional software consists of the following components:

IO and Projector Control (rc_iocontrol, Section \ref{iocontrol:sect-
iocontrol})  provides control over the rc_visard's general purpose
inputs and outputs with special modes for controlling an external
random dot projector.

TagDetect (rc_april_tag_detect and rc_qr_code_detect, Section
\ref{tagdetect:sect-tag-detection})  allows the detection of AprilTags
and QR codes, as well as the estimation of their poses.

ItemPick and BoxPick (rc_itempick and rc_boxpick, Section
\ref{itempick:sect-itempick})  provides an out-of-the-box perception
solution for robotic pick-and-place applications of unknown objects or
boxes.

SilhouetteMatch (rc_silhouettematch, Section \ref{silhouettematch
:sect-silhouettematch})  provides an object detection solution for
objects placed on a plane.

CADMatch (rc_cadmatch, Section \ref{cadmatch:sect-cadmatch})  provides
an object detection solution for 3D objects.

CollisionCheck (rc_collision_check, Section \ref{collisioncheck:sect-
collision})  provides an easy way to check if a gripper is in
collision with load carrier.

The

rc_cube

 provides some common functionalities which are used in multiple
optional software components. The common functionalities are:

Load carrier functionality\:(Section \ref{loadcarrier:sect-
loadcarrier})  allows setting and retrieving load carriers, as well as
detecting load carriers and their filling level.

Region of interest functionality\:(Section \ref{roi:sect-roi})  allows
setting and retrieving 3D regions of interest.
