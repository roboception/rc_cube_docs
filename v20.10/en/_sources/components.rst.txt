Software components

The

rc_cube

 comes with several on-board software components, each of which
corresponds to a certain functionality and can be interfaced via its
respective

node

 in the

REST-API interface

.

The

Stereo camera

 and the

Stereo matching

 components, which acquire stereo image pairs and compute 3D depth
information such as disparity, error, and confidence images, are also
accessible via the

rc_cube

's

GigE Vision/GenICam interface

.

The

rc_cube

's base software consists of the following components:

Stereo camera (rc_stereocamera, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-
stereo-camera})  acquires stereo image pairs and performs planar
rectification for using the stereo camera as a measurement device.
Images are provided both for further internal processing by other
components and for external use as GenICam image streams.

Stereo matching (rc_stereomatching, Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
stereo-matching})  uses the rectified stereo image pairs to compute 3D
depth information such as disparity, error, and confidence images.
These are provided as GenICam streams, too.

Hand-eye calibration (rc_hand_eye_calibration, Section
\ref{handeye_calibration:sect-handeye-calibration})  enables the user
to calibrate the camera with respect to a robot, either via the Web
GUI or the REST-API.
