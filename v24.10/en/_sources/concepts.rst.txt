Measurement principles

The

rc_cube

 is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device that is used in
combination one or more 3D cameras such as Roboception's 3D camera

rc_visard

. Together, they provide rectified camera, disparity, confidence, and
error images, which allow the viewed scene's depth values along with
their uncertainties to be computed.

In the following, the underlying measurement principles are explained
in more detail.
