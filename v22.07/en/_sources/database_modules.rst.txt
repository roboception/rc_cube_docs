Database modules

The

rc_cube

 provides several database modules which enable the user to configure
global data which is used in many detection modules, such as load
carriers and regions of interest. Via the

REST-API interface

 the database modules are only available in API version 2.

The database modules are:

LoadCarrierDB (rc_load_carrier_db, Section \ref{loadcarrier_db:sect-
loadcarrier-db})  allows setting, retrieving and deleting load
carriers.

RoiDB (rc_roi_db\:, Section \ref{roi:sect-roi})  allows setting,
retrieving and deleting 2D and 3D regions of interest.

GripperDB (rc_gripper_db, Section \ref{gripper_db:sect-gripper-db})
allows setting, retrieving and deleting grippers for collision
checking.

These modules are global on the

rc_cube

, which means that they run outside the camera pipelines. Changes to
their settings or parameters affect all pipelines running on the

rc_cube

.
