Overview

The

rc_cube

 is a high-performance 3D-image-processing device. It enhances the
computing capabilities of the Roboception stereo camera

rc_visard

 and supports the Basler blaze camera in an RGB-D setup and the

rc_viscore

.

Information about the supported devices are provided in

rc_visard: https://doc.rc-visard.com

rc_viscore: https://doc.rc-viscore.com

Note: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual
  applies to both the

  rc_visard

   65 and

  rc_visard

   160 versions of the Roboception

  rc_visard

   sensor.

Note: The term "blaze" used throughout the manual always refers to
  the Basler blaze camera in an RGB-D setup, i.e. the blaze Time-of-
  Flight camera in combination with the Basler aceA1300 color camera.

The

rc_cube

 provides real-time camera images and depth images, which can be used
to compute 3D point clouds. Additionally, it provides confidence and
error images as quality measures for each image acquisition. It offers
an intuitive web UI (user interface) and a standardized GenICam
interface, making it compatible with all major image processing
libraries.

With optionally available software modules the

rc_cube

 provides out-of-the-box solutions for object detection and robotic
pick-and-place applications.

The

rc_cube

 is offered in two versions:

rc_cube S

 and

rc_cube I

.

The

rc_cube S

 is suitable for research, development and testing environments. It
supports one

rc_visard

 without additional hardware. A separate 2.5Gbit switch (not part of
the product scope) enables the support of two

rc_visard

 devices at a time or allows to connect an

rc_viscore

 or a Basler blaze device.

The

rc_cube I

 is intended for operational use in an industrial environment. It
supports four

rc_visard

 cameras, or two

rc_viscore

 or Basler blaze devices without additional hardware.


Note: Unless specified, the information provided in this manual
  applies to both the

  rc_cube S

   and

  rc_cube I

   versions of the

  rc_cube

  .

Note: This manual uses the metric system and mostly uses the units
  meter and millimeter. Unless otherwise specified, all dimensions in
  technical drawings are in millimeters.
