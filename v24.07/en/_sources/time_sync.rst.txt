Time synchronization

The

rc_cube

 provides timestamps with all images and messages. To compare these
with the time on the application host, the time needs to be properly
synchronized.

The time synchronization between the

rc_cube

 and the application host can be done via the Network Time Protocol
(NTP), which is activated by default.

Internal time synchronization between the

rc_cube

 and the connected camera is automatically done via the Precision Time
Protocol (PTP).

The current system time as well as time synchronization status can be
queried via

REST-API

 and seen on the

Web GUI

's

System

 page.

Note: Depending on the reachability of NTP servers or PTP masters it
  might take up to several minutes until the time is synchronized.

NTP

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a TCP/IP protocol for synchronizing
time over a network. A client periodically requests the current time
from a server, and uses it to set and correct its own clock.

By default the

rc_cube

 tries to reach NTP servers from the NTP Pool Project, which will work
if the

rc_cube

 has access to the internet.

If the

rc_cube

 is configured for

DHCP

 (which is the default setting), it will also request NTP servers from
the DHCP server and try to use those.

Additionally, the user can specify up to three NTP servers manually
using the REST-API's

/system/ntp

 endpoint. A more convenient way is setting the NTP servers on the

Web GUI

's

System Time

 page.

PTP

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP, also known as IEEE1588) is a
protocol which offers more precise and robust clock synchronization
than with NTP.

Note: Currently, time synchronization between the application host
  and the

  rc_cube

   is not implemented. Please use NTP instead.

Setting time manually

The

rc_cube

 allows to set the current date and time manually using the REST-API's

/system/time

 endpoint, if no time synchronization is active (see

System and logs

). A more convenient way is setting the system time on the

Web GUI

's

System Time

 page.
