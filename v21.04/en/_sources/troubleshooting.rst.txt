Troubleshooting

Camera-image issues

The camera image is too bright

If the camera is in manual exposure mode, decrease the exposure time
(see Parameters, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}), or

switch to auto-exposure mode (see Parameters, Section
\ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}).

The camera image is too dark

If the camera is in manual exposure mode, increase the exposure time
(see Parameters, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}), or

switch to auto-exposure mode (see Parameters, Section
\ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}).

The camera image is too noisy

Large gain factors cause high-amplitude image noise. To decrease the
image noise,

use an additional light source to increase the scene's light
intensity, or

choose a greater maximal auto-exposure time (see Parameters, Section
\ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}).

The camera image is out of focus

Check whether the object is too close to the lens and increase the
distance between the object and the lens if it is.

Check whether the camera lenses are dirty and clean them if they are.

If none of the above applies, a severe hardware problem might exist.
Please contact support\:(Section \ref{contact:sect-contact}).

The camera image is blurred

Fast motions in combination with long exposure times can cause blur.
To reduce motion blur,

decrease the motion speed of the camera,

decrease the motion speed of objects in the field of view of the
camera, or

decrease the exposure time of the camera (see Parameters, Section
\ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}).

The camera image frame rate is too low

Increase the image frame rate as described in Parameters\:(Section
\ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}).

The maximal frame rate of the cameras is 25 Hz.

Depth/Disparity, error, and confidence image issues

All these guidelines also apply to error and confidence images,
because they correspond directly to the disparity image.

The disparity image is too sparse or empty

Check whether the camera images are well exposed and sharp. Follow the
instructions in Camera-image issues\:(Section \ref{troubleshooting
:sect-camera-issues}) if applicable.

Check whether the scene has enough texture (see Stereo matching,
Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-stereo-matching}) and install an
external pattern projector if required.

Decrease the Minimum Distance\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Increase the Maximum Distance\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Check whether the object is too close to the cameras. Consider the
different depth ranges of the rc_visard variants.

Decrease the Minimum Confidence\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Increase the Maximum Depth Error\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Choose a lesser Disparity Image Quality\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching
:sect-disp-image-parameters}). Lower resolution disparity images are
generally less sparse.

The disparity images' frame rate is too low

Check and increase the frame rate of the camera images (see
Parameters, Section \ref{stereo_camera:sect-cam-params}). The frame
rate of the disparity image cannot be greater than the frame rate of
the camera images.

Choose a lesser Disparity Image Quality\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching
:sect-disp-image-parameters}).

Increase the Minimum Distance\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}) as much as possible for the application.

The disparity image does not show close objects

Check whether the object is too close to the cameras. Consider the
depth ranges of the rc_visard variants.

Decrease the Minimum Distance\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

The disparity image does not show distant objects

Increase the Maximum Distance\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Increase the Maximum Depth Error\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Decrease the Minimum Confidence\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

The disparity image is too noisy

Increase the Segmentation value\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Increase the Fill-In value\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-
image-parameters}).

The disparity values or the resulting depth values are too inaccurate

Decrease the distance between the camera and the scene. Depth-
measurement error grows quadratically with the distance from the
cameras.

Check whether the scene contains repetitive patterns and remove them
if it does. They could cause wrong disparity measurements.

The disparity image is too smooth

Decrease the Fill-In value\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-
image-parameters}).

The disparity image does not show small structures

Decrease the Segmentation value\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-
disp-image-parameters}).

Decrease the Fill-In value\:(Section \ref{stereo_matching:sect-disp-
image-parameters}).

GigE Vision/GenICam issues

No images

Check that the modules are enabled. See ComponentSelector and
ComponentEnable in Important GenICam parameters\:(Section
\ref{gigevision:sect-genicam-params}).
